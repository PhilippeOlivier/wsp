  Abstract                 = {Assembly lines are cost efficient production systems that mass produce identical products. Due to customer demand, manufacturers use mixed model assembly lines to produce customized products that are not identical. To stay efficient, management decisions for the line such as number of workers and assembly task assignment to stations need to be optimized to increase throughput and decrease cost. In each station, the work to be done depends on the exact product configuration, and is not consistent across all products. In this paper, we propose a mixed model line balancing integer program (IP) that considers parallel workers, zoning, task assignment, and ergonomic constraints with the objective of minimizing the number of workers. Upon observing the limitation of the IP, a Constraint Programming (CP) model is developed to solve larger assembly line balancing problems. Data from an automotive OEM are used to assess the performance of both the MIP and CP models, including sensitivity analysis to measure the computational cost of enabling the different constraints. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first paper to incorporate the different realistic mixed model assembly line constraints and develop a CP model based on the scheduling module of the IBM ILOG Optimizations Studio. Using the OEM data, we show that the CP model outperforms the IP model for bigger problems.},

  Abstract                 = { We present a new criterion space search algorithm, the balanced box method, for finding all nondominated points of a biobjective integer program. The method extends the box algorithm, is easy to implement, and converges quickly to the complete set of nondominated points. Because the method maintains, at any point in time, a diverse set of nondominated points, it is ideally suited for fast approximation of the efficient frontier. In addition, we present several enhancements of the well-known ε-constraint, augmented weighted Tchebycheff, and perpendicular search methods. An extensive computational study, using instances from different classes of combinatorial optimization problems, demonstrates the efficacy of the balanced box method. },

This problem is seen to be -complete from a number of different perspectives. We describe the problem model and heuristic algorithm that is used on the commercial website www.weddingseatplanner.com . We present results on the performance of this algorithm, demonstrating the factors that can influence run time and solution quality, and also present a comparison with an equivalent IP model used in conjunction with a commercial solver.},

  Abstract                 = {We use a local search method we term Large Neighbourhood Search (LNS) to solve vehicle routing problems. LNS is analogous to the shuffing technique of job-shop scheduling, and so meshes well with constraint programming technology. LNS explores a large neighbourhood of the current solution by selecting a number of ``related'' customer visits to remove from the set of planned routes, and re-inserting these visits using a constraint-based tree search. Unlike similar methods, we use Limited Discrepancy Search during the tree search to re-insert visits. We analyse the performance of our method on benchmark problems. We demonstrate that results produced are competitive with Operations Research meta-heuristic methods, indicating that constraint-based technology is directly applicable to vehicle routing problems},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce a constraint for one-dimensional bin packing. This constraint uses propagation rules incorporating knapsack-based reasoning, as well as a lower bound on the number of bins needed. We show that this constraint can significantly reduce search on bin packing problems. We also demonstrate that when coupled with a standard bin packing search strategy, our constraint can be a competitive alternative to established operations research bin packing algorithms.},
